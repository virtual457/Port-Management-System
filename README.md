### Core Database Tables

```sql
-- Users & Role Management
users, roles, user_roles

-- Maritime Infrastructure
ports, berths, berth_assignments

-- Fleet Management
ships, routes, schedules

-- Cargo & Booking Management
cargo, cargo_bookings, connected_bookings, connected_booking_segments
```

## üßÆ Advanced SQL Implementation

### Pathfinding Algorithms in SQL

The system implements **Dijkstra-like pathfinding algorithms** using SQL to find optimal shipping routes:

#### 1. Direct Route Finding
```sql
-- Finds direct routes between ports with capacity constraints
CREATE PROCEDURE find_direct_routes(
    IN p_origin_port_id INT,
    IN p_destination_port_id INT,
    IN p_earliest_date VARCHAR(50),
    IN p_latest_date VARCHAR(50),
    IN p_cargo_id INT
)
```

#### 2. Connected Route Finding (Multi-Segment)
```sql
-- Implements graph traversal to find connected routes
CREATE PROCEDURE find_all_routes(
    IN p_origin_port_id INT,
    IN p_destination_port_id INT,
    IN p_earliest_date VARCHAR(50),
    IN p_latest_date VARCHAR(50),
    IN p_cargo_id INT,
    IN p_max_connections INT
)
```

#### 3. Route Optimization with CTEs
```sql
WITH 
direct_routes AS (
    -- Direct route logic
),
first_segments AS (
    -- First segment of connected routes
),
second_segments AS (
    -- Second segment of connected routes
),
connected_routes AS (
    -- Join segments to form connected routes
)
```

### Complex Business Logic in Stored Procedures

#### Berth Availability Management
```sql
-- Real-time berth availability checking with conflict detection
CREATE PROCEDURE check_berth_availability(
    IN p_berth_id INT,
    IN p_start_time DATETIME,
    IN p_end_time DATETIME,
    OUT p_is_available BOOLEAN,
    OUT p_conflict_details VARCHAR(255)
)
```

#### Connected Booking Management
```sql
-- Multi-segment booking with transaction management
CREATE PROCEDURE create_connected_booking(
    IN p_cargo_id INT,
    IN p_user_id INT,
    IN p_schedule_ids VARCHAR(255),
    IN p_notes TEXT,
    OUT p_booking_id INT,
    OUT p_success BOOLEAN,
    OUT p_message VARCHAR(255)
)
```

### Advanced Query Patterns

#### 1. Recursive CTEs for Route Traversal
```sql
-- Finding all possible route combinations
WITH RECURSIVE route_paths AS (
    -- Base case: direct routes
    SELECT route_id, origin_port_id, destination_port_id, 1 as depth
    FROM routes WHERE origin_port_id = @start_port
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case: connected routes
    SELECT r.route_id, r.origin_port_id, r.destination_port_id, rp.depth + 1
    FROM routes r
    JOIN route_paths rp ON r.origin_port_id = rp.destination_port_id
    WHERE rp.depth < @max_depth
)
```

#### 2. Window Functions for Analytics
```sql
-- Ship utilization analysis with ranking
SELECT 
    ship_name,
    utilization_percent,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY utilization_percent DESC) as rank
FROM ship_utilization_data
```

#### 3. Spatial Queries
```sql
-- Finding ports within distance using spatial functions
SELECT 
    port_id, name, 
    ST_Distance(location, POINT(@user_lat, @user_lng)) as distance
FROM ports 
WHERE ST_Distance(location, POINT(@user_lat, @user_lng)) < @max_distance
```
